# Analysis-of-Health-Facilities-in-Sub-Saharan-Africa
Building on my analysis of health facilities in sub-Saharan Africa, where I explored country-level and state-level distribution, facility ownership, and facility types, I aim to further drill down and provide in-depth insights specifically for Nigeria, shedding light on the nuances of healthcare infrastructure within the country.

## Project Overview
This analysis utilizes a [dataset](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/health-facilities-in-sub-saharan-africa) compiled by Maina, J., Ouma, P.O., Macharia, P.M., et al., as part of their research titled [A spatial database of health facilities managed by the public health sector in sub-Saharan Africa, published in 2019.](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/334289719_A_spatial_database_of_health_facilities_managed_by_the_public_health_sector_in_sub_Saharan_Africa)

The goal is to explore the distribution of health facilities at country and state levels, examining facility types and ownership structures. The analysis will also focus specifically on Nigeria, investigating state-level distribution, ownership, facility types, and healthcare service tiers within the country.

## Tools and Methodology
1. SQL (querying and analyzing data)
2. Data Exploration (understanding the data)
3. Data Cleaning (preparing the data for analysis)
4. Aggregation (grouping and summarizing data)
5. CTE (Common Table Expressions, a powerful SQL feature)

## Data Profiling
This dataset comprises 98,745 rows and 8 columns, featuring 6 categorical variables (Country, Admin1, Facility name, Facility type, Ownership, and LL Source) stored as varchar, and 2 numerical variables (Lat and Long, representing latitude and longitude). Upon inspection, null values are present in several columns: Ownership (30,448 nulls), Lat (6,041 nulls), Long (3,095 nulls), and LL Source (2,350 nulls). Additionally, the dataset contains 1367 duplicate rows. After removing these duplicates, the dataset is refined to 97,378 unique rows.


#### Number of columns
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS Column_count
FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'sub_saharan_health_facilities';
```
| Column_count |
| --- |
| 8 |


#### Number of rows
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS Row_count
FROM sub_saharan_health_facilities;
```
| Row count |
| --- |
| 98745 |


#### Columns & Data-Types
```
SELECT Column_name,
data_type
FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'sub_saharan_health_facilities';
```
| Column Name | Data Type |
| --- | --- |
| Country | text |
| Admin1 | text |
| Facility_name | text |
| Facility_type | text |
| Ownership | text |
| Lat | int |
| Long | int |
| LL_source | text |

#### Checking for Null Values
``` sql
SELECT 
    SUM(CASE WHEN Country ='' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS null_Country,
    SUM(CASE WHEN Admin1 ='' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS null_Admin1,
    SUM(CASE WHEN Facility_n ='' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS null_Facility_Name,
    SUM(CASE WHEN Facility_t ='' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS null_Facility_Type,
    SUM(CASE WHEN Ownership ='' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS null_Ownership,
    SUM(CASE WHEN Lat ='' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS null_Lat,
    SUM(CASE WHEN `Long` ='' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS null_Long,
    SUM(CASE WHEN LL_source ='' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS null_LLSource
FROM sub_saharan_health_facilities;
```
| null_Country | null_Admin1 | null_Facility_Name | null_Facility_Type | null_Ownership | null_Lat | null_Long | null_LLSource |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 30448 | 6041 | 3095 | 2350 |


#### Duplicate Rows Count
```sql
WITH Duplicates AS
      (SELECT *,
      ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY Country, Admin1, Facility_n, LL_source, Facility_t, Ownership, Lat, 'Long') AS row_num
      FROM sub_saharan_health_facilities)
SELECT COUNT(*) AS Num_of_Duplicate_Rows
FROM Duplicates
WHERE row_num > 1;
```
| Num_of_Duplicate_Rows |
| --- |
| 1367 |


## Data Cleaning
To make permanent changes to the dataset, I created a new table by duplicating the main table's data, and then applied data cleaning transformations, including  dropping duplicate rows, removing irrelevant columns, updating null values, and correcting irregularities to ensure a refined dataset for analysis.  I then added a new column called "row_num" to store the ROW_NUMBER() function, which helped identify duplicate rows by assigning a unique number to each row within a partition. This allowed me to easily remove duplicates by deleting rows with row_num greater than 1 (>1). 


#### Table Duplication
``` sql
CREATE TABLE `sub_saharan_health_facilities_ANA` (
  `Country` text,
  `Admin1` text,
  `Facility_name` text,
  `Facility_type` text,
  `Ownership` text,
  `Lat` int DEFAULT NULL,
  `Long` int DEFAULT NULL,
  `LL_source` text,
  row_num int) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci;
```

Copying data from the main table to a new table in preparation for permanent changes.
```sql
INSERT INTO sub_saharan_health_facilities_ANA
SELECT *,
ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY Country, Admin1, Facility_n, LL_source, Facility_t, Ownership, Lat, 'Long') AS row_num
FROM sub_saharan_health_facilities;
```


#### Removal oF Duplicates
```sql
DELETE
FROM sub_saharan_health_facilities_ANA
WHERE row_num > 1;
```


*Number of rows after duplicates removal*
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS Row_count
FROM sub_saharan_health_facilities_ANA;
```
| Row_count |
| --- |
| 97378 |


#### Removal of Irrelevant Columns
```sql
ALTER TABLE sub_saharan_health_facilities_ANA
DROP COLUMN `Long`,
DROP COLUMN Lat, 
DROP COLUMN row_num;
```


*Columns available after dropping irrelevant columns*
```
SELECT Column_name,
data_type
FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'sub_saharan_health_facilities_ANA';
```
| Column Name | Data Type |
| --- | --- |
| Country | text |
| Admin1 | text |
| Facility_name | text |
| Facility_type | text |
| Ownership | text |


#### Addressing Blank Values or Null Values 
```sql
UPDATE sub_saharan_health_facilities_ANA
SET Ownership = 'NULL'
WHERE Ownership = '';
```


#### Standardizing data
This involves transforming and formatting data into a consistent and uniform structure, making it easier to work with, analyze, and compare. This process includes data formatting, normalization, cleansing, and transformation to improve data quality, reduce errors, and enable accurate analysis and insights. By standardizing data, inconsistencies are removed, and data becomes more reliable, allowing for better decision-making and more effective use of data-drivenÂ insights.
